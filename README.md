And the core mechanism that drives the games is the trading teams. Developing trade teams which could in theory almost act as criminal organizations if they chose. Trading against one another. Sabotaging other teams. "Team members can't make it to the exchange because other players broke into their house and stole their access badge." Also incorporating a type of Rust survival mechanism in the game.
